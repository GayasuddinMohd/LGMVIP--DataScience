# Exploratory Data Analysis on Terrorism  
The Terrorism Dataset Analysis delves into the complex landscape of terrorist incidents worldwide, shedding light on patterns, trends, and dynamics related to acts of terrorism. In this exploratory data analysis (EDA), we will analyze the dataset to uncover insights into terrorist attacks, their characteristics, locations, and the evolving nature of global terrorism.

# Skills
* Python

# Dataset  
* Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd?select=globalterrorismdb_0718dist.csv).

# Insights
* 2014 was the deadliest year, where the maximum number of attacks takes place.
* After 2010 there is huge growth in the terrorist attacks in almost all regions of the world.
* Middle East & North Africa and South Asia has the highest number of attacks among all regions in the world.
* Iraq is the most affected country from the terrorism.
* Terrorist used Bombing/Explosion as a target method most number of times.
* Taliban is the most active terrorist organization in the world.
* Iraq is that country where terrorists killed most number of people.
* Baghdad is the most affected city in the world from terrorism.
* Around 1970 terrorist killed most number of people in Nort America.But it very good to see that the number of people dying from terrorist attacks in Nort America are decreasing after 1970.It may be beacuse of the increasing security measures in the Nort America.
* In Pakistan, Afghanistan and India the graph of number of people killed by terrorism increases after 2010.
* Negligible people killed in the terrorism before 2000 in Iraq and before 2010 in Syria.But it is ver sad to know that after 2000 the graph of the people killed by terrorism in Iraq is increased at very higher rates.The US invasion of Iraq may be one of major reason of increasing terrorism In Iraq.
* In 2014 is the worst year for Iraqis.In the year 2014, 13965 people was killed by terrorism.And if we talk about the organization which is responsible for most number of iraqis death is Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) attacks about more than 1000 times in year 2014.
* Terrorists target Private Citizens & Property maximum number of times.

# Iris Flower Classification
This Project is thorugh application of machine learning with python programming. It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools. 

# Technologies Used  
* Python
* Machine Learning

# Dataset  
* Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv?select=Iris.csv).

# Final conclusion
* The testing accuracy is 1.0 which is higher than training accuracy.This suggests that model will make accurate prediction on new sample.
* The training accuarcy is 0.97 which is slightly less than testing accuracy.This indicates that the model fit the training data quite well.
* Overall model exhibits high accuracy on both the training and testing data, which is a positive outcome.
