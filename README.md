# ðŸŒ¸  Terrorism  ðŸŒ¸ 
Terrorism, the calculated use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective.

# ðŸŒ¸  Exploratory Data Analysis on Terrorism  ðŸŒ¸
The Terrorism Dataset Analysis delves into the complex landscape of terrorist incidents worldwide, shedding light on patterns, trends, and dynamics related to acts of terrorism. In this exploratory data analysis (EDA), we will analyze the dataset to uncover insights into terrorist attacks, their characteristics, locations, and the evolving nature of global terrorism.

# ðŸŒ¸  Repository Overview  ðŸŒ¸
This repository is about EDA performed on the Terrorism.
   - It has a python notebook where all the coding has been done.
   - It also has the relevant datasets and files used for this analysis.

# ðŸŒ¸  Technologies Used  ðŸŒ¸
* Python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly
* Jupyter Notebok
* Kaggle
* Statistics

# ðŸŒ¸  Dataset  ðŸŒ¸
* You can download the dataset from the kaggle website.
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd?select=globalterrorismdb_0718dist.csv   - 

# ðŸŒ¸  Summary  ðŸŒ¸
* 2014 was the deadliest year, where the maximum number of attacks takes place.
* After 2010 there is huge growth in the terrorist attacks in almost all regions of the world.
* Middle East & North Africa and South Asia has the highest number of attacks among all regions in the world.
* Iraq is the most affected country from the terrorism.
* Terrorist used Bombing/Explosion as a target method most number of times.
* Taliban is the most active terrorist organization in the world.
* Iraq is that country where terrorists killed most number of people.
* Baghdad is the most affected city in the world from terrorism.
* Around 1970 terrorist killed most number of people in Nort America.But it very good to see that the number of people dying from terrorist attacks in Nort America are decreasing after 1970.It may be beacuse of the increasing security measures in the Nort America.
* In Pakistan, Afghanistan and India the graph of number of people killed by terrorism increases after 2010.
* Negligible people killed in the terrorism before 2000 in Iraq and before 2010 in Syria.But it is ver sad to know that after 2000 the graph of the people killed by terrorism in Iraq is increased at very higher rates.The US invasion of Iraq may be one of major reason of increasing terrorism In Iraq.
* In 2014 is the worst year for Iraqis.In the year 2014, 13965 people was killed by terrorism.And if we talk about the organization which is responsible for most number of iraqis death is Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) attacks about more than 1000 times in year 2014.
* Terrorists target Private Citizens & Property maximum number of times.
* Year 2014 is the deadliest year in the history of terrorism. About 16000 people died in the single year by terrorism.

# ðŸŒ¸  Conclusion  ðŸŒ¸
Through this EDA, we aim to understand the dynamics of terrorism, its global reach, and the impact on societies. The analysis will provide insights into the evolution of terrorist tactics, the role of regions, and the need for effective counterterrorism measures.

As we delve into this dataset, we acknowledge the tragic nature of terrorist incidents and their far-reaching consequences. The Terrorism Dataset Analysis serves as a reminder of the challenges that nations and societies face in confronting acts of violence and extremism, and the importance of fostering security, peace, and international cooperation.

# ðŸŒ¸  Image to Pencil Sketch with Python  ðŸŒ¸
Converting an image to a pencil sketch is a creative and fun image manipulation technique. In this tutorial, we will use Python to convert a regular image into a pencil sketch, giving it a hand-drawn and artistic appearance.

# ðŸŒ¸  Libraries Used  ðŸŒ¸ 
We will primarily use the following Python libraries for this task:
1. OpenCV: For image manipulation and processing.
2. NumPy: For numerical operations on arrays.
3. Matplotlib: For displaying the original and sketch images.

# ðŸŒ¸  Conclusion  ðŸŒ¸
Image to pencil sketch conversion is a fascinating technique that transforms ordinary images into artistic drawings. By leveraging Python libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib, you can experiment with various images and create captivating sketches.

As we explore this creative process, we recognize the power of programming in generating visually appealing and imaginative outputs. This technique can serve as a starting point for more advanced image manipulation projects and artistic endeavors.
